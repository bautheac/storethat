## storethat

storethat is one of the workhorses of the [finRes](https://bautheac.github.io/finRes/) suite where it plays the important role of providing off-Bloomberg storage solutions for financial data retireved from Bloomberg using the [pullit](https://bautheac.github.io/pullit/) package. [storethat](https://bautheac.github.io/storethat/) and [pullit](https://bautheac.github.io/pullit/) work in conjuction with the [BBGsymbols](https://bautheac.github.io/BBGsymbols/) package that provides carefully selected Bloomberg datafields for pullit to query data for and for storethat to store the corresponding retrieved data. Both packages are flexible to BBGsymbols content dynamics in that enhancing BBGsymbols with new datafield(s) won't alter data queries in pullit nor storethat storage facilities with any existing database eventually upgrading for the new field(s) on first encounter.
